If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.\n\nSo is the cat alive or dead?",

(Zombie cat ftw)\n\nThe other popular interpretation is the many worlds interpretation. In this case, the cat is alive in one world and dead in the other.",
